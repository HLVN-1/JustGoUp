# JustGoUp
A climbing app for the OKC community. 

The goal is to create something similar to an existing app, Griptonite. I want to be able to create a floorplan of a climbing gym in OKC and have a list of routes corresponding to where they're set in the gym. Users will be able to select a route, mark how many attempts they made, whether they succeeded or not, and earn points depending on how many tries it took them. Just to start out!
